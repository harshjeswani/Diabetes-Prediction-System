# Diabetes-Prediction-System
A Diabetes Prediction System uses machine learning to predict diabetes risk based on health data, enabling early detection and timely intervention.
Project Description
This project implements a machine learning-based Diabetes Prediction System that predicts the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health parameters like glucose levels, BMI, age, and family history. The system uses machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks to classify users as diabetic or non-diabetic. The goal of this system is to provide early predictions and allow individuals to take preventive actions, promoting a healthier lifestyle and reducing healthcare costs.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow (if using neural networks)
Web Development (if applicable): Flask, React (for web deployment)
Database (optional): MySQL, SQLite (for storing user data)
Other Libraries: Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing), Matplotlib (visualizations)
Features
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collects and preprocesses health data (e.g., glucose levels, BMI).
Machine Learning Models: Implements algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
Real-Time Prediction: Users input their data to get immediate predictions about their diabetes risk.
User Interface: Simple and easy-to-use interface (can be a CLI or web app).
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
